Let $R$ be a domain. (a) If $F$, $G$ are forms of degree $r$, $s$ respecitvely
in $R[X_1,\dots,X_n]$, show that $FG$ is a form of degree $r+s$. (b) Show that
any factor of a form in $R[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ is also a form.

Write $F = \sum_{|I|=r}a_IX^I$, $R = \sum_{|J|=s}b_JX^J$ in obvious notation.
Then

$$FG=\sum_{|I|=r, |J|=s}a_Ib_JX^{I+J}.$$

Since giving two multi-indices $I$, $J$ of degrees $r$, $s$ is the same thing as
giving two multindices $J$ and $K$ of degree $s$ and $k=r+s$, since $I$ can be
recovered as $I = K - J$. Thus:

$$FG=\sum_{|K|=r+s}\left(\sum_{|J|=s}a_{K-J}b_J\right)X^K$$
