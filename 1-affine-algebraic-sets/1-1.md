Let $R$ be a domain. (a) If $F$, $G$ are forms of degree $r$, $s$ respecitvely
in $R[X_1,\dots,X_n]$, show that $FG$ is a form of degree $r+s$. (b) Show that
any factor of a form in $R[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ is also a form.

Write $F = \sum_{|I|=r}a_IX^I$, $R = \sum_{|J|=s}b_JX^J$ in obvious notation.
Then

$$FG=\sum_{|I|=r, |J|=s}a_Ib_JX^{I+J}.$$

Since giving two multi-indices $I$, $J$ of degrees $r$, $s$ is the same thing as
giving two multindices $J$ and $K$ of degree $s$ and $k=r+s$, since $I$ can be
recovered as $I = K - J$. Thus:

$$FG=\sum_{|K|=r+s}\left(\sum_{|J|=s}a_{K-J}b_J\right)X^K,$$

which shows part (a).

For part (b), let $F$ be a non-zero element of $R[X_1,\dots,X_n]$, and suppose
that $F=GH$. Define $l(F)$ as the exponent of the _lowest_ non-zero term of $F$.
Then it is easy to check that:

- $l(GH) = l(G) + l(H)$,
- $l(G)\leq\deg(G)$ and $l(G)=\deg(G)$ if and only if $G$ is a form

Since $F$ is a form we have that $l(GH)=d(GH)$, ie $l(G)+l(H)=d(G)+d(H)$.
By the second bullet point then, (b) comes down to the following statement about
(positive) integers: given integers $l_1, d_1, l_2, d_2$ such that

- $l_1\leq d_1$, $l_2\leq d_2$, and
- $l_1+l_2=d_1+d_2$

then, $l_1 = d_1$ and $l_2 = d_2$. It is enough to prove that $l_1=d_1$ (the
case of $l_2$ and $d_2$ being completely symmetric).
We have:
$$d_1 \geq l_1 = l_1 +l_2 - l_2 = d_1 + d_2 - l_2 \geq d_1,$$
which shows $d_1 = l_1$.
