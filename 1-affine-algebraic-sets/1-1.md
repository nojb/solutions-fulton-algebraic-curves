Let $R$ be a domain. (a) If $F$, $G$ are forms of degree $r$, $s$ respecitvely
in $R[X_1,\dots,X_n]$, show that $FG$ is a form of degree $r+s$. (b) Show that
any factor of a form in $R[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ is also a form.

Write $F = \sum_{|I|=r}a_IX^I$, $R = \sum_{|J|=s}b_JX^J$ in obvious notation.
Then

$$FG=\sum_{|I|=r, |J|=s}a_Ib_JX^{I+J}.$$

Since giving two multi-indices $I$, $J$ of degrees $r$, $s$ is the same thing as
giving two multindices $J$ and $K$ of degree $s$ and $k=r+s$, since $I$ can be
recovered as $I = K - J$. Thus:

$$FG=\sum_{|K|=r+s}\left(\sum_{|J|=s}a_{K-J}b_J\right)X^K,$$

which shows part (a).

For part (b), let $F$ be a non-zero element of $R[X_1,\dots,X_n], and suppose
that $F=GH$ and let us assume that $G$ is _not_ a form. We want to prove that
then $F$ is not a form either. Since $G$ is not a form, we can write $G = G_r +
G_s + G_1$ where $G_r$ is a monomial of degree $r$, $G_s$ a monomial of degree
$s > r$ and every monomial of $G_1$ of degree $> s$ ($G_1$ may be zero).

Then, $GH = G_sH + G_rH + G_1H$. Since $H$ is non-zero, it has a lowest non-zero
exponent with coefficient $c$: $H = cH^d + H_1$ where every monomial of $H_1$ is
$> d$. Then $GH = cG_sX^d + cG_rX^d + G_sH_1 + G_rH_1 + cG_1X^d + G_1H_1$. As
each of the terms of $G_sH_1$, $G_rH_1$, $cG_1X^d$, $G_1H_1$ has degree $> s+d$
and ..., we conclude that $GH$ is not a form, which shows (b).
