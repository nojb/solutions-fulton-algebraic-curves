**Let $k$ be an infinite field, $F\in k[X_1,\dots,X_n]$. Suppose
$F(a_1,\dots,a_n)=0$ for all $a_1,\dots,a_n\in k$. Show that $F=0$.  (Hint:
Write $F=\sum F_iX_n^i$, $F_i\in k[X_1,\dots,X_{n-1}]$. Use induction on $n$,
and the fact that $F(a_1,\dots,a_{n-1},X_n)$ has only a finite number of roots
if any $F_i(a_1,\dots,a_{n-1})\neq 0$.)**

We proceed by induction on $n$. If $n=0$, it is obvious. Suppose $n>0$ and let
$F\in k[X_1,\dots,X_n]$ be as in the statement. We can write
$$F=\sum F_iX_n^i$$
with $F_i\in k[X_1,\dots,X_{n-1}]$.
We fix $a_1,\dots,a_{n-1}$ and consider the polynomial in one variable
$$F(a_1,\dots,a_{n-1},X_n)=\sum F_i(a_1,\dots,a_{n-1})X_n^i.$$
If $F(a_1,\dots,a_{n-1},X_n)\neq 0$, then it would have finitely many roots. As
$k$ is infinite, there would exist $a_n\in k$ such that
$F(a_1,\dots,a_{n-1},a_n)\neq 0$, contrary to the hypothesis.  Thus we conclude
that $F(a_1,\dots,a_{n-1},X_n) = 0$, which means that every coefficient must be zero:
$F_i(a_1,\dots,a_{n-1})=0$ for all $i$. As $a_1,\dots,a_{n-1}\in k$ were arbitrary,
we can apply the induction hypothesis to each $F_i$ and conclude that $F_i=0$
for all $i$, and thus that $F=0$.
