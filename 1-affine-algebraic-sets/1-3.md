**Let $R$ be a PID, Let $P$ be a nonzero, proper, prime ideal in $R$. (a) Show
that $P$ is generated by an irreducible element. (b) Show that $P$ is maximal.**

To show (a), let $t\in R$ be so that $P=(t)$ (it exists as $R$ is principal). We
will show that $t$ is irreducible. Since $P$ is non-zero, $t$ is non-zero.
Since $P$ is proper, $t$ is not a unit. Thus it suffices to show that if $t=ab\in R$
then either $a$ or $b$ is a unit.  As $P$ is prime, $ab = t\in P$
implies that either $a\in P$ or $b\in P$. By symmetry it is enough to consider
the case $a\in P$: $a = tr$ for some $r\in R$. Substituting, we get $t = trb$,
so $1 = rb$, so $b$ is a unit in $R$.

We now pass to (b). Let $P=(t)$ and let $x\in R$. As $R$ is principal,
$(x,t)=(d)$ for some $d\in R$. Hence $t = da$ for some $a\in R$.  Because $t$ is
irreducible by (a), it follows that either $d$ is a unit or $a$ is a unit. If
$d$ is a unit, then $x$ is a unit in $R/P$, and the proof is done. Otherwise,
$a$ is a unit, so that $(x, t) = (t)$, from where it follows that
$x\in(t)=P$. We have shown that every non-zero element in $R/P$ is a unit, ie
that $R/P$ is a field, hence $P$ is maximal.
