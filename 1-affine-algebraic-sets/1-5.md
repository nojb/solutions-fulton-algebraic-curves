**Let $k$ be any field. Show that there are an infinite number of irreducible
monic polynomials in $k[X]$. (Hint: Suppose $F_1,\dots,F_n$ were all of them,
and factor $F_1\cdots F_n+1$ into irreducible factors.)**

As in the hint, let us suppose that there are only finitely many monic
irreducibles in $k[X]$, say, $F_1,\dots,F_n$. Let $F=F_1\cdots F_n+1$.  Since
$0\neq 1$, there are at least two irreducibles $X$ and $X-1$ in the list.  It
follows that $F$ is neither zero nor a unit (because $\deg F=\sum\deg F_i>\deg F_i$ for all
$i$). Thus it is divisible by an irreducible: $F=GH$, $G$ irreducible.
We claim that $G$ is not among $F_1,\dots,F_n$. Indeed, if $G$ was among the $F_i$,
it follows from $F=\sum F_i + 1$ that $G$ is a unit, contradiction.
