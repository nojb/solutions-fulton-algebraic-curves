**Let $k$ be any field. Show that there are an infinite number of irreducible
monic polynomials in $k[X]$. (Hint: Suppose $F_1,\dots,F_n$ were all of them,
and factor $F_1\cdots F_n+1$ into irreducible factors.)**

As in the hint, let us suppose that there are only finitely many monic
irreducibles in $k[X]$, say, $F_1,\dots,F_n$. Let $F=F_1\cdots F_n+1$.  Since
there is at least one irreducible ($X$)i, it follows that $F$ is neither zero
nor a unit. Thus it is divisible by an irreducible: $F=GH$, $G$ irreducible.  We
claim that $G$ is not among $F_1,\dots,F_n$. Indeed, if $G$ was among the $F_i$,
it follows from $F=F_1\cdots F_n+1$ that $G$ is a unit, contradiction.
