**Show that any algebraically closed field is infinite. (Hint: The irreducible
monic polynomials are $Xâˆ’a$, $a\in k$.)**

Suppose that $k$ is finite and let
$$F=\prod_{a\in k}(X-a)+1.$$
By definition, $F(a)=1$ for all $a\in k$.  Since $k\neq\emptyset$, $F$ is
non-constant. As $k$ is algebraically closed, $F$ has a root $b\in k$: $F(b) =
0$. Contradiction.
