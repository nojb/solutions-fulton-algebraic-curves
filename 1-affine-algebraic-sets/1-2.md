**Let $R$ be a UFD, $K$ the quotient field of $R$. Show that every element $z$ of
$K$ may be written $z=a/b$, where $a,b\in R$ have no common factors; this
representative is unique up to units of $R$.**

By definition of the field of fractions, $z=a_1/b_1$ for some $a_1,b_1\in R$.
As $R$ is a UDF, we can write
$$a_1=u\prod_p p^{\alpha_p}$$
and
$$b_1=v\prod_p p^{\beta_p}$$
where the $\alpha_p$ and $\beta_p$ are zero except for a finite number of $p$,
and $u$ and $v$ are units of $R$. Then
$$a_1/b_1 = uv^{-1}\prod_p p^{\alpha_p-\beta_p}$$
It is enough to choose $a = u\prod_{\alpha_p > \beta_p}p^{\alpha_p-\beta_p}$
and $b = v\prod_{\alpha_p < \beta_p}p^{\beta_p - \alpha_p}$.

For uniquess up to units of $R$, suppose that $a/b = a'/b'$ in $K$ with $a, b$
and $a', b'$ without common factors. Then $ab' = ba'$ in $R$ (since $R$ is a
domain). It follows that $a$ divides $ba'$ but $a$ is coprime with $b$, so $a$
divides $a'$. By symmetry, $a'$ divides $a$, so $a$ and $a'$ are
associated. Similarly, $b$ and $b'$ are associated.
